[Tyler Hall](https://twitter.com/tylerhall) is a Mac, iOS, and (former) web developer from Nashville, TN.

After spending three years as an engineer working for Yahoo! in San Francisco, I'm now working on my own apps under my tiny software development company, [Click On Tyler](https://clickontyler.com). We make productivity software for web developers and designers. Our flagship apps, [VirtualHostX](https://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/), [Hostbuddy](https://clickontyler.com/hostbuddy/), and [Hobo](https://clickontyler.com/hobo/), are loved by over fifty-thousand web developers.

You can stalk me further on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tylerhall), [GitHub](https://github.com/tylerhall), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylerhall). Here's a small collection of my [past projects](/portfolio/) - both commercial and open source - as well as [what I'm currently working on]({{site_base_url}}now/).

I occasionally take on interesting freelance projects, and my real résumé is available upon request.

Oh. And I like baseball. A lot.
