Here's what I'm currently working on (last updated March 25, 2020):

* [VirtualHostX Pro](https://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/) shipped on December 2, 2019. This was the next major release of my local macOS web development environment and the biggest one yet. It's also the first product I've ever shipped that uses a subscription pricing model.
* [Rebudget](https://clickontyler.com/rebudget/) shipped on January 1, 2020. All December, folks were posting about what they accomplished and how they spent the 2010s. Rather than look back on the past decade, I thought it would be more fun to look forward to whatâ€™s to come. So, I tried my damndest to make something new in time for the new year. It's a Mac app called Rebudget that makes forecasting your personal finances a breeze.
* I'm also [working on a few other Mac and iOS apps]({{site_base_url}}workshop/) that are fairly far along in the development process, but not quite ready for prime time.

Books I'm reading:

* [The Man They Wanted Me to Be](https://www.amazon.com/Man-They-Wanted-Me-Masculinity/dp/1640091815/) by [Jared Yates Sexton](https://twitter.com/JYSexton)
* [My Father Left Me Ireland](https://www.amazon.com/My-Father-Left-Me-Ireland/dp/0525538658/) by [Michael Brendan Dougherty](https://twitter.com/michaelbd)

My current jams:

* [The Wood Brothers: Kingdom in My Mind](https://songwhip.com/album/the-wood-brothers/kingdom-in-my-mind) I look forward to their new albums more than any other artist - and this new one doesn't disappoint. Jump at the opportunity to see them live if you ever get the chance.
