Here's what I'm currently working on (last updated May 16, 2020):

* [VirtualHostX Pro](https://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/) shipped on December 2, 2019. This was the next major release of my local macOS web development environment and the biggest one yet. It's also the first product I've ever shipped that uses a subscription pricing model.
* After being in beta since January, [Rebudget](https://clickontyler.com/rebudget/) offically launched April 1, 2020 [directly to customers](https://clickontyler.com/rebudget/) and [on the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rebudget-personal-finances/id1502478863?ls=1). Rather than tracking your finances, the app is designed to help you _forecast_ your budget and compare different financial plans and decisions.
* I also recently released [Ears](https://clickontyler.com/ears/). It's a pay-what-you-want micro-app that lets you switch your Mac's audio input and output devices with just a keyboard shortcut - no mouse needed. It's ideal for folks who frequently switch between AirPods, 3rd party bluetooth headsets, and their Mac's internal speakers or headphone jack.

Books I'm reading:

* [Masters of Doom](http://www.davidkushner.com/book/masters-of-doom/) by David Kushner
* [The Man They Wanted Me to Be](https://www.amazon.com/Man-They-Wanted-Me-Masculinity/dp/1640091815/) by [Jared Yates Sexton](https://twitter.com/JYSexton)

On heavy rotation:

* [Warren Zevon: Preludes](https://songwhip.com/album/warren-zevon/preludes)

* [God Don't Never Change: The Songs of Blind Willie Johnson](https://songwhip.com/album/various-artists/god-dont-never-change-the-songs-of-blind-willie-johnson)
* [The Wood Brothers: Kingdom in My Mind](https://songwhip.com/album/the-wood-brothers/kingdom-in-my-mind) I look forward to their new albums more than any other artist - and this new one doesn't disappoint. Jump at the opportunity to see them live if you ever get the chance.
