Today I lost about four hours debugging what I thought was a bizarre bug due to my own ignorance. Now, I don‚Äôt want to be too hard on myself  - no one can be an expert in every nook and cranny of a tech stack as large as AppKit. But, still, this one <em>really</em> knocked me on my butt when I realized my mistake.

Tonight I tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/tylerhall/status/1239734350532546565">this</a>...

The bug I was running into happened when I dragged an <code>NSTextField</code> out of an <code>NSStackView</code> and dropped it elsewhere in the window. In the gif below you‚Äôll see that after the drop completes, the <code>NSTextField</code> lingers behind - continuing to duplicate each time I drag  and drop it.

Note: Only the <em>original</em> <code>NSTextField</code> is draggable. The copies left behind don‚Äôt accept mouse events.

So, I start debugging this. My first thought is there‚Äôs some sort of race condition happening because when I drop the <code>NSTextField</code>, the change persists to my Core Data stack - which does the usual <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code> merge dance and then posts a notification letting the other views in the window know there‚Äôs new data and they should refresh. (I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the proper way to do it, but it‚Äôs how I approached it in this situation.)

That notification ‚Üí refresh isn‚Äôt necessarily anything crazy or complex, but once the change finishes persisting to Core Data, my CloudKit code picks up the new data and pushes it up to the customer‚Äôs iCloud account. I don‚Äôt just do a push to CloudKit, though. The data model for this app is very, very tiny. So, I‚Äôm saving myself some added complexity and just doing an actual two-way sync each time. And, of course, when the sync completes - üí• - my views are told to reload any additional changes from the sync session.

I‚Äôve messed up code like this plenty of times before and I‚Äôm hoping my first instinct is correct and I‚Äôm somehow maybe adding an extra copy of the <code>NSTextField</code> twice to the <code>NSStackView</code>?

Here‚Äôs the pertinent code. It removes any existing tasks from the <code>NStackView</code> and then loops through the new data adding a view for each item back into the stack view.

<pre><code>        monthDayView.clearTasks()
        for t in tasks {
            let taskView = t.taskView()
            monthDayView.stackView.addArrangedSubview(taskView)
        }
</code></pre>

Heres‚Äô the implementation for <code>clearTasks()</code> above:

<pre><code>    func clearTasks() {
        for view in stackView.arrangedSubviews {
            stackView.removeArrangedSubview(view)
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<em>(For the seasoned <code>NSStackView</code> readers out there who can already see the bug in my code, please hold your laughter while I explain the next frustrating hour of my evening in excruciating detail...)</em>

Seems safe enough, right? But still, my eyes don‚Äôt lie. There‚Äôs clearly a duplicate <code>NSTextField</code> hanging around. Let‚Äôs dig deeper.

I start with the app in this state:

<img class="alignnone size-full" src="{{site_cdn}}/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/stackview-bug-count.png" width="2240" height="1844" />

I add this debugging code to confirm if the stack views really do or do not have the number of arranged views I‚Äôm expecting:

<pre><code>print(monthDayView.stackView.arrangedSubviews.count)
</code></pre>

In the screenshot above, March 18 is the ‚Äúreal‚Äù item, and the other three are the weird zombie copies. For each of those views, the above debugging code gives me these results:

<ul>
<li>March, 18: <code>1 views</code> <em>OK!</em></li>
<li>March, 10: <code>0 views</code> <em>wtf?</em></li>
<li>March, 16: <code>0 views</code> üí©</li>
<li>March, 24: <code>0 views</code> ü•É</li>
</ul>

Um? That seems...wrong? Those extra views are clearly still there.

Firing up Xcode‚Äôs wonderful view debugger, however, completely blew my mind and shattered any remaining self-confidence I had as an app developer...

<img class="alignnone size-full" src="{{site_cdn}}/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/threethings-view-debug-scaled.jpeg" width="2560" height="1880" />

There's not just <em>one</em> extra <code>NSTextField</code> hanging about. There. Are. <em>Thirty</em>. Of them.

Clearly at this point I am missing something incredibly obvious and foundational about the situation and frameworks in order for my (I think) relatively simple code to be breaking this badly. Let‚Äôs start from first principles and re-read the documentation.

Relatively speaking, <code>NSStackView</code>  is a newish part of AppKit. It‚Äôs only been around since Mac OS X (<em>not</em> macOS) 10.9 Mavericks. Regardless, in the seven years since then, I haven‚Äôt ever really used it <em>that</em> often. I know it‚Äôs there and a nice tool to have available, but I‚Äôm just not super familiar with it. And as you‚Äôll soon see, even less so than I thought.

I‚Äôm reading through Apple‚Äôs documentation in Xcode and I finally stumble upon <code>removeArrangedSubview(_:)</code>...

<img class="alignnone size-full" src="{{site_cdn}}/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/stackview-docs.png" width="2356" height="1406" />

I think <em>that‚Äôs strange for a seven year old API, but ok</em> and keep browsing.

Nearly an hour later I‚Äôm really questioning everything I thought I knew about ones and zeroes until a google search leads me to <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/31/4/removing-views-from-a-uistackview-with-removearrangedsubview">this page</a>. And, sure enough, my bug is spelled out right there:

> However, using <code>removeArrangedSubview()</code> <strong>doesn‚Äôt</strong> remove the view altogether ‚Äì it keeps the view in memory, which is helpful if you plan to re-add it later on because you can avoid recreating it. Here, though, we actually want to remove the web view and destroy it entirely, and that can be done with a call to <code>removeFromSuperview()</code> instead.

Holleeee crap. I never knew stack views worked that way. (Thanks, <a href="https://twitter.com/twostraws">Paul</a>!) I mean, wow. That is a very basic misunderstanding on my part. So, I add one additional line of code:

<pre><code>    func clearTasks() {
        for view in stackView.arrangedSubviews {
            stackView.removeArrangedSubview(view)
            view.removeFromSuperview()
        }
    }
</code></pre>

and üí• it works. Not only does it work, but it also fixes a number of other peripheral bugs that I had logged but not investigated yet.

Anyway, I hope this excessively long post has enough keywords stuffed into it so that anyone else facing the same problem can find it.

But, last point. Why didn‚Äôt Apple‚Äôs documentation mention this very important detail? More so, why isn‚Äôt that method documented <em>at all</em>?

Ha, well. Turns out, they <em>did</em> document it. My empty screenshot above is from Xcode‚Äôs documentation browser. However, if you go to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstackview/1488925-removearrangedsubview">the same documentation on the developer website</a> you‚Äôll see...

Well played, Apple.
