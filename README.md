# [Roland](https://github.com/tylerhall/Roland/) Sample Website

This is a sample website to be built with [Roland](https://github.com/tylerhall/Roland/) - a static website generator written in Swift.

It's the real assets and templates used to build my blog ([tyler.io](https://tyler.io)). The HTML and CSS is from the excellent [TwentyTwenty theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwenty/) included with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) - with a few tweaks of my own.

Plese refer to the Roland project for details about how the files in this website are structured.

The compiled website output is stored in the [`_www`](https://github.com/tylerhall/Roland-sample-website/blob/master/_www) directory for you to browse. Normally, that folder would be excluded from source control.
